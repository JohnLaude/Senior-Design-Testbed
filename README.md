# Senior-Design-Testbed
Repository for Senior Design Project for Fall 2020

Hello, if you are reading this then you are downloading Senior Design Testbed made by UMass Boston student to help people with VLC and OWC research. 

This testbed code is under the assumption of a few different things: 
  - RaspAP has been downloaded on nodes that we will act as Relays and Access Points
  - Passwordless authorization for raspberry pis for testbed controller device
  - Speedtest client 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
**RaspAP Download:** 

Install RaspAP from your deviceâ€™s shell prompt using the command below:
```
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash
```

**Speedtest Download**

**Using SSH.py**

Make sure that you are in the correct directory first before you run the file. The file would be a python file and is meant to test out all the raspberry pi at once and make sure they are connected.
